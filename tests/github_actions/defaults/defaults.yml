# Purpose
# =======
# This file defines the default settings for the test workflow. It contains all
# variables. The variables can then be overridden in more specific yaml files
# to run different test scenarios.
#
# Variables used in multiple steps will be defined in the "workflow" and "global"
# sections and we use anchors to reference them in the specific sections. We use
# yamllint to validate the files, make sure to add linter exceptions, when you
# break the rules.
#
# We can use Golang templates in these test plans, see https://github.com/joernott/load_testplan/blob/main/README.md
# on how to reference environment variables and the github context.
#
# Sections
# ========
# The yaml hierarchy will be flattened to simple key=value settings. The
# various levels of the yaml file here will become prefixes to the variable
# names. For each step of the testplan, we use use a section to have the
# variables for that step contain the same prefix.
#
# The "workflow" section contains global definitions of matrix variables and
# settings used in the "strategy" parts of a job. They have anchors and every
# specific job has its own variables which reference these anchors if no
# job specific exceptions are needed.
#
# The "global" section is much the same. The variables here are defaults with
# anchors which will be used inside the steps of the various other sections.
#

# Global settings for a jobs strategy setting
workflow:

  # The variables "php", "mysql" and template_engine in the "matrix" subsection
  #  are used to run a matrix of all combinations of these values for testing.
  matrix: &matrix
    # This string contains a json array of php versions to test against.
    php: &matrix_php '["8.1","8.2"]'

    # This json array are the mysql versions to test
    mysql: &matrix_mysql '["5.7","8.0"]'

    # This json array contains a list of template engines to test, use '["smarty","twig"]' for both
    template_engine: &template_engine '["twig"]'

  # This matrix definition is used, when we only want one analysis done
  # It covers the recommended combination of PHP and MySQL
  matrix_slim: &matrix_slim
    php: &matrix_php_slim '["8.2"]'
    mysql: &matrix_mysql_slim '["8.0"]'

  # How many matrix tests should run in parallel. When running on our private runners, we need to
  # reduce this to get consistent test results
  max_parallel: &max_parallel 4

# Global settings used in the actual steps in the jobs
global:
  # This action can be used on the community edition (ce) and enterprise
  # edition (ee) of the shop. On top of setting this to true, a few extra
  # variables/secrets must be provided for using the action on ee.
  # If is enterprise is set to true, you need to provide the following
  # - secrets.enterprise_github_token
  # - testplan entry global.git_enterprise_ref
  is_enterprise: &is_enterprise false
  # This template variable must be set to "ce" if is_enterprise is false or "ee"
  # if is_enterprise is true. It will be used for determining object names
  # {{ $shop_type := "ce" }}$shop_type: {{ printf "%q" $shop_type }}
